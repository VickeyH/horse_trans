The Horse Transcriptome project 
===============================
Most of the gene models of the current horse genome lack trancriptional evidence support. This project develops a pipeline for analysis of RNAseq to fullfill these aims:
1. Provide more accurate gene models with trascriptional evidence.
2. Compare tissue specific gene models
3. Test the effect of intgrative analysis of several RNAseq experiments 
4. Use GitHub and UCSC genome browser to provide a scientific collaprative plateform for laboratories intrested in the horse functional genomics.
   
This github project contains all the scripts required to reproduce the analysis of the horse transcriptome project on the HPC of Michigan state university. Also it has the basic tree structure of the UCSC track hub. This design will allow the community to share in developiong the track hub and also they can fork to have their own version with different view options.
